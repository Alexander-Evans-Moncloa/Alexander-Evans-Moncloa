Hi, Iâ€™m @Alexander-Evans-Moncloa

Interested MOSTLY in computer vision and control/path planning algorithms for applications in robotics. Python and C++ are the primary languages for these tasks (depending on complexity and hardware available).

Also dabbling a bit into HTML, SQL, CSS and SQL in order to run an ecommerce website, linked to a database to improve personalisation of my business.


Fun fact: 

The Boltzmann brain theory is more likely to be real than us actually being only 13.7 billion years into the universe. Controversial claim, I know.
