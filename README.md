Interested MOSTLY in computer vision and control/path planning algorithms for applications in robotics. Python and C++ are the primary languages for these tasks, currently learning ROS2 to integrate both for complex tasks. Some SystemVerilog code here too for FPGAs.

Also dabbling a bit into Docker, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Nginx and SQL in order to run a ecommerce website/personal portfolio, linked to a functional database on a Linux Debian server. You can visit it now on https://okak.co.uk/.

Fun fact: 
The Boltzmann brain theory is more likely to be real than us actually being only 13.7 billion years into the universe. Controversial claim, I know.
